🫡 Yo, I’m @0xAoiii

👁️🫦👁️ I’m interested in writing code that works once, and then never again — like a cursed spell from a forgotten programming language.

🌱🥀 I’m currently learning how to center a div, escape Vim, and escape the crushing weight of my own tech debt.

🤝🔥 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where we deploy on Fridays, debug on weekends, and gaslight each other into thinking it’s “just a small fix.”

🐦📟 How to reach me: Open your terminal, type sudo summon @0xAoiii, sacrifice a rubber duck, and chant “merge conflicts be gone” three times. Or y’know, DM me.

🙃🧍‍♂️ Pronouns: he/him, but also answers to “bruh,” “yo,” and the sound of keyboards being aggressively smashed.

⚰️😂 Fun fact: My code runs perfectly... after 47 commits, 6 ritual sacrifices to the CI gods, and a nervous breakdown.

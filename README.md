Yo, I’m @0xAoiii

I’m interested in writing code that works once, and then never again — like a cursed spell from a forgotten programming language.

I’m currently learning how to center a div, escape Vim, and escape the crushing weight of my own tech debt.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects where we deploy on Fridays, debug on weekends, and gaslight each other into thinking it’s “just a small fix.”

How to reach me: Open your terminal, type sudo summon @0xAoiii, sacrifice a rubber duck, and chant “merge conflicts be gone” three times. Or y’know, DM me.

Pronouns: he/him, but also answers to “bruh,” “yo,” and the sound of keyboards being aggressively smashed.

Fun fact: My code runs perfectly... after 47 commits, 6 ritual sacrifices to the CI gods, and a nervous breakdown.
